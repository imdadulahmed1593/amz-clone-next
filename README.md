## Overview

- This is an Amazon clone built with React and NextJS which uses TailwindCSS for styling and supports Server-side rendering.

### The challenge

- This was my first project with NextJS. Learnt a lot about NextJs and its prebuilt functionalities like server-side rendering, file-based routing system, image optimization with next/image and NextAuth. Hope to know more about this amazing React Framework in future.
